= 2.2. Make A Change 
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:experimental:

== 2.2.1. Changing the source code

Now, let's simulate a scenario where we have a new update in the application (source code) and want to re-build the application with the change. 

[start=1]
. In the file named "main.go", look for line 26 and change the text from "Hello" to "Hello there" as shown in the image below
+
image::maingo.png[main.go]

. Compile the simpleweb application with the new change by running the following command
+
 $ go build \
     -buildvcs=false \
     -a \
     -installsuffix cgo \
     -o ./simpleweb \
     .

. Verify that the simpleweb application has been compiled
+ 
 $ ls
+
   LICENSE  README.md  bindata.go  cicd-lab  devfile.yaml  go.mod  go.sum  main.go  public  simpleweb

== 2.2.2. Building a New Version of Your Container Image 

Once `simpleweb` is compiled successfully, we can now go ahead to build the container image! 

For building the container image, we will be making use of Podman Build command. `podman build` builds an image using instructions from one or more Containerfile(s) a specified build context directory. 

. Run the following on your Visual Studio Code terminal
+
 $ podman build -t podman-simpleweb:v2 .

. Validate that the container image (v2) has been built successfully 
+
 $ podman images
+
   REPOSITORY                           TAG                  IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE
   localhost/podman-simpleweb           v2                   27970bae2dae  14 seconds ago  222 MB
   localhost/podman-simpleweb           v1                   27970bae2dae  14 seconds ago  222 MB

== 2.2.3. Pushing the v2 Container Image Into Your Quay Registry

Now that we have successsfully built our container image, we shall push this image into the Quay registry. 
You will need to first login to the Quay regsitry using the following command

Export Quay Registry URL as an environment variable

`+export QUAY_URL=+`{quay_registry}

. Login to Quay Registry 
+
 $ podman login \
     ${QUAY_URL} \
     --username %USER% \
     --password redhat


. Tag the Container Image
+
 $ podman tag \
     localhost/podman-simpleweb:v2 \
     ${QUAY_URL}/%USER%/podman-simpleweb:v2

. Push the Container Image into your Quay Registry
+
 $ podman push ${QUAY_URL}/%USER%/podman-simpleweb:v2

== 2.2.4. Accessing Your MicroShift Instance

Now that your have your container image in your Quay Registry, you can now access into your MicroShift instance and deploy the simeplweb application using that container image. 

. Access your MircoShift VM via SSH
+
 $ ssh rhde@microshift-service.%USER%.svc.cluster.local
+ 
When prompted with "Are you sure you want to continue connecting", enter "yes"
+
When prompted with password, use - `password`


== 2.2.5. Pulling the Container Image from your Quay Registry

. Login to Quay Registry 
+
 $ podman login \
     ${QUAY_URL} \
     --username %USER% \
     --password redhat

. Pull the podman-simpleweb:v2 image from the Quay registry
+
 $ podman pull ${QUAY_URL}/%USER%/podman-simpleweb:v2

. Validate that the container image has been successfully pulled and you should be able to see the podman-simpleweb image
+
 $ podman images
+
   REPOSITORY                                                                                       TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE
   registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-ck6cg.sandbox2981.opentlc.com/user1/podman-simpleweb  v2          27970bae2dae  17 minutes ago  222 MB
   registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-ck6cg.sandbox2981.opentlc.com/user1/podman-simpleweb  v1          27970bae2dae  17 minutes ago  222 MB

== 2.2.6. Running the container using the podman-simpleweb image

. Build and run with podman run command, let's name this container: podman-simpleweb
+
 $ podman run -d -p 8080:8080 --name podman-simpleweb \ 
   ${QUAY_URL}/%USER%/podman-simpleweb:v2

. Verify that the container is running successfully
+
 $ podman ps
+
  CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                                                                               COMMAND     CREATED         STATUS        PORTS       NAMES
  29bc1542e8e2  registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-ck6cg.sandbox2981.opentlc.com/user1/podman-simpleweb:v1              14 seconds ago  Up 2 seconds              podman-simpleweb

== 2.2.7. Testing the application

. Use the curl command to test the application
+
 $ curl localhost:8080 

. Stop and Remove the Simple Web Container
+
 $ podman stop podman-simpleweb   
 $ podman rm podman-simpleweb 

== 2.2.8. Congratulations!

You have successfully compiled and re-built your application with the reflected change in source code. We learnt how easy it was to deploy applications using container images and running containers on MicroShift. We also saw how simple it was to redploy a container if there were any changes in the source code.

You are now done with the first half of the hands-on workshop!
