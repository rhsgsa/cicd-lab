. The pipeline clones from a Java source git repo, builds the application, creates a container image, pushes the container image to an image registry, and deploys the image to your namespace in OpenShift

. If you wish to examine the artifacts that were used to deploy the pipeline, you can look through the files in the {GIT_URL}/%USER%/pipeline[pipline git repo,window=git]

In this module, we will trigger the pipeline for the first time. We will do this by triggering a webhook from the application source git repo.

. Open the {GIT_URL}/%USER%/sample-app[application source git repo,window=git] in a new browser tab

. Sign in using your assigned username and password
