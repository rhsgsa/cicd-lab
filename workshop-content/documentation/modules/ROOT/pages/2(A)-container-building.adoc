= Container Building
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:experimental:

Welcome to Part A of the Hands-On Workshop! In this section, we will be making use of Dev Spaces environment which has Visual Studio Code running as an IDE on it.

[start=1]
. Login to the {DEVSPACES_URL}#{GIT_URL}/%USER%/path/to/devfile.yaml[OpenShift Dev Spaces Console,window=console] in a new browser tab - and enter your assigned username and password

. Select the terminal window on the top left and open up a new terminal
+

. Change your working directory into the cicd-lab directory by running the following command
+
 $ cd cicd-lab

. Change directory once again into the sample-app directory by running the following command
+
 $ cd sample-app

. Compile the simpleweb application by running the following command
+
 $ go build \
     -buildvcs=false \
     -a \
     -installsuffix cgo \
     -o ./simpleweb \
     .


== Building Your First Container Image 

Once `simpleweb` is compiled successfully, we can now go ahead to build the container image! 

For building the container image, we will be making use of Podman Build command. `podman build` Builds an image using instructions from one or more Containerfile(s) a specified build context directory. 

. Run the following on your Visual Studio Code 
+
 $ podman build -t podman-simpleweb:v1 .

. Validate that the container image has been built successfully 
+
 $ podman images


== Pushing the Container Image Into Your Quay Registry

Now that we have successsfully built our container image, we shall push this image into the Quay registry. 
You will need to first login to the Quay registry using the following command

. Login to Quay Registry 
+
 $ podman login \
     registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-vcdn4.sandbox1757.opentlc.com \
     --username %USER% \
     --password redhat


. Tag the Container Image
+
 $ podman tag \
     localhost/myimage:v1 \
     registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-vcdn4.sandbox1757.opentlc.com/%USER%/podman-simpleweb:v1

. Push the Container Image into your Quay Registry
+
 $ podman push registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-vcdn4.sandbox1757.opentlc.com/%USER%/podman-simpleweb:v1

. Verify that the image has been built on Quay using the following link
+
 xx

== Accessing Your MicroShift Instance

Now that your have your container image in your Quay Registry, you can now access into your MicroShift instance and deploy the simeplweb application using that container image. 

. Access your bastion via SSH
+
 $ ssh lab-user@bastion.vcdn4.sandbox1757.opentlc.com
+ 
When prompted with password, use - xxx

. Login to the MicroShift VM
+
 $ virtctl ssh \
     rhde@microshift.%USER% \
     --identity-file=/home/lab-user/.ssh/id_rsa


== Pulling the Container Image from your Quay Registry

. Login to Quay Registry 
+
 $ podman login \
     registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-vcdn4.sandbox1757.opentlc.com \
     --username %USER% \
     --password redhat

. Pull the podman-simpleweb:v1 image from the Quay registry
+
 $ podman pull registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-vcdn4.sandbox1757.opentlc.com/%USER%/podman-simpleweb:v1

. Validate that the container image has been successfully pulled and you should be able to see the podman-simpleweb image. 
+
 $ podman images


== Building the container using the podman-simpleweb image

. Creating a container using podman create
+
 $ podman create \
     --name podman-simpleweb \
     registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-vcdn4.sandbox1757.opentlc.com/%USER%/podman-simpleweb:v1

. Start the container
+
 $ podman start podman-simpleweb


== Testing the application

. Run the exec command to run a new /bin/bash command inside the container mycontainer
+
 $ podman exec -it mycontainer /bin/bash 
+
 $ curl localhost:8080


== Congratulations!

You have successfully compiled and built your application using the container image and creating a container from it, getting the desired output. Moving on to the next section, we will make a change in the source code and re-build the container to see the reflected changes.
