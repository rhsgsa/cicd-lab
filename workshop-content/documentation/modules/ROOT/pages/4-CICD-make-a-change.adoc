= 4. Make A Change
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In this module, we will make a change to the application. This should trigger the pipeline, initiating build and deployment of the application.

. We will make changes to the `main.go` file in Dev Spaces for this exercise

. Change the greeting in line 26 from `Hello` to `Good Morning`

. Follow the same steps as previous exercise to commit and push the change to the git repository

. Switch back to the OpenShift Console - a new pipeline run should have been triggered by the webhook

. Wait for the pipeline run to complete

. Once the pipelines has been completed, you can repeat the curl statement on the DevSpaces console by executing the following command: 
+
 $ curl microshift-vmiservice.%USER%.svc.cluster.local:8081

. Now you should be able to see the new output on your terminal:
+
 simpleweb-b4975f85f-gdlvr: Good Morning World

== 4.1. Conclusion
You have successfully compiled and re-built your application with the reflected change in source code. You are now done with the last part of the hands-on workshop!
