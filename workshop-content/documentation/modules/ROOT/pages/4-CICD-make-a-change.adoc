= 4. Make A Change
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In this module, we will make a change to the application. This should trigger the pipeline, initiating build and deployment of the application.

. Open {GIT_URL}/%USER%/sample-app/src/branch/main/main.go[`main.go` in the `sample-app` git repo,window=git]

. Click on Edit File

. Change the greeting in line 26 from `Hello` to `Good Morning`

. Commit the change

. Switch back to the OpenShift Console - a new pipeline run should have been triggered by the webhook

. Wait for the pipeline run to complete

. Once the pipelines has been completed, you can repeat the curl statement on the DevSpaces console by executing the following command: 
+
 $ curl microshift-vmiservice.%USER%.svc.cluster.local:8081

. Now you should be able to see the new output on your terminal:
+
 simpleweb-b4975f85f-gdlvr: Good Morning World

== 4.1. Conclusion
You have successfully compiled and re-built your application with the reflected change in source code. You are now done with the last part of the hands-on workshop!
