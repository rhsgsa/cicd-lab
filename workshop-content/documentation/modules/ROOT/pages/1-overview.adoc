== 1.1. Goal of the Workshop
The goal of this lab is to assess the benefits of using containers on MicroShift by providing a hands-on experience in building a container image and using podman to create and run containers. This lab also aims to showcase the integration of CI/CD processes to automate certain tasks. At the end of this workshop, you should be able to appreciate the benefits of building and running containers on MicroShift. All the best!

== 1.2. Workshop Environment

. `Gitea` is a community git server to host the source code repositories 

. `OpenShift GitOps` to manage the deployed services using a GitOps approach through ArgoCD

. `OpenShift Pipelines` to build the customer application from source code and deploy using GitOps

. `Red Hat Quay` is a distributed and highly available container image registry. It provides a single and resilient content repository for delivering containerized software to development and production across OpenShift clusters.

== 1.3. Workshop Environment Login Information

. Red Hat OpenShift Console URL: {console_url}[OCP URL]

. Red Hat Quay Console URL: {quay_url}[Quay URL]

. Red Hat Dev Spaces Console URL: {devspaces_url}[Dev Spaces URL]

. Gitea repository URL: {git_url}[Gitea URL]

. Your Username is %USER% and your password is `redhat`

*Important*
You have to use an unique username, e.g. %USER% while youâ€™re running the hands-on labs. You will need to deploy applications onto your own project/namespace, e.g. e.g. %USER%.

=== 1.3.1. Accessing your OpenShift Cluster
