== 1.1. Goal of the Workshop
The goal of this lab is to assess the benefits of using containers on MicroShift by providing a hands-on experience in building a container image and using podman to create and run containers. This lab also aims to showcase the integration of CI/CD processes to automate certain tasks. At the end of this workshop, you should be able to appreciate the benefits of building and running containers on MicroShift. All the best!
