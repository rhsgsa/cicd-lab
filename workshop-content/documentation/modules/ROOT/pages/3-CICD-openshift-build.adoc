= 3. CI/CD OpenShift Build

This section showcases the integration of CICD with Microshift. A CICD pipeline has been provisioned in your OpenShift namespace. Let's take a look at the pipeline in the OpenShift Console.

[start=1]

. Go to OpenShift pipeline, i.e. {console_url}/pipelines/ns/%USER%/ and click on the `build-and-deploy` pipeline to view the Tekton pipeline.

. The pipeline clones from the git repo, builds the application, creates a container image, pushes the container image to an image registry, scans the image for vulnerabilities and deploys the image to the Micorshift VM if it is deemed to be good and free of critical CVEs.

. If you wish to examine the artifacts that were used to deploy the pipeline, you can look through the files in the {GIT_URL}/%USER%/pipeline[pipline git repo,window=git]

== Initial Build
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In this module, we will trigger the pipeline for the first time. We will do this by triggering a webhook from the application source git repo.

. Open the {GIT_URL}/%USER%/sample-app[application source git repo,window=git] in a new browser tab

. Sign in using your assigned username and password

. A webhook has been configured in this git repo to trigger the pipeline - examine the webhook by selecting menu:Settings[Webhooks > `\http://el-build-and-deploy...`]
+

. Trigger the webhook by scrolling to the bottom of the page and clicking on Test Delivery
+

. Examine the {CONSOLE_URL}/pipelines/ns/%USER%/pipeline-runs[PipelineRuns screen in the OpenShift Console,window=console] - you should see a new pipeline run running

. Continuous scanning and assurance can be achieved by integrating CI/CD Pipelines and Image Registries with the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes
. Wait for the pipeline run to fail due to security vulnerabilities that was flagged out by the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes
. The image scanning failed due to a high severity CVE, i.e. `RHSA-2023:5997` that is fixed in the latest Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI)
+

. Examine the image with high severity CVE in Red Hat Quay. Go to the following link, i.e. {quay_url}/repository/%USER%/simpleweb-training?tab=tags to get more information of the vulnerability.

. Update the UBI image to the latest available version to fix the security issue

. Change the current base image in line 1 from `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:8.8-1067.1697633337` to `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest`. The Dockerfile should look like the image below:
+

. The latest UBI image will contain the fix for the CVE that was detected earlier on the older UBI image

. Commit the change
+
image::commit_changes_devspaces.png[Commit Change]

. Click Yes
+
image::stage_commit_changes_devspaces.png[Stage and Commit Change]

. Sync and Push the change
+
image::sync_changes_devspaces.png[Sync and Push Change]

. Key in user name, i.e. %USER% when prompted in VSCode
+
image::key_in_git_username.png[Key in Username]

. Key in password, i.e. `redhat` when prompted in VSCode
+
image::key_in_git_password.png[Key in Password]

. Switch back to the OpenShift Console - a new pipeline run should have been triggered by the webhook

. Wait for the pipeline run to complete

. Test that the application is running properly by accessing the DevSpaces terminal and executing the following command: 
+
 $ curl microshift-vmiservice.%USER%.svc.cluster.local:8081

. You should be able to see something similar in the output on your terminal:
+
 simpleweb-b4975f85f-gdlvr: Hello there World

. Next, proceed to make a change in the `main.go` file

. Change the greeting in line 26 from `Hello` to `Good Morning`
+
image::update_main_go.png[Update main.go]

. Follow the same steps as before to commit and push the change to the git repository

. Switch back to the OpenShift Console - a new pipeline run should have been triggered by the webhook

. Wait for the pipeline run to complete
+
image::final-working-pipeline.png[Complete Working Pipeline]

. Once the pipelines has been completed, you can repeat the curl statement on the DevSpaces console by executing the following command: 
+
 $ curl microshift-vmiservice.%USER%.svc.cluster.local:8081

. Now you should be able to see the new output on your terminal:
+
 simpleweb-b4975f85f-gdlvr: Good Morning World

== 4.1. Conclusion
In this exercise, you get to see how Dev Spaces, OpenShift Pipelines, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes and Red Hat Quay can be used for the CICD of applications that can then be deployed on the MicroShift. You are now done with the last part of the hands-on workshop!
