= 2.1. Container Building on MicroShift
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:experimental:

In this section, we will be making use of Dev Spaces environment which has Visual Studio Code running as an IDE on it. At the end of this section, you would have built a container image and a container in which an application named "simpleweb" is running. 

[start=1]
. Login to the {DEVSPACES_URL}#{GIT_URL}/%USER%/path/to/devfile.yaml[OpenShift Dev Spaces Console,window=console] in a new browser tab - and enter your assigned username and password
+
image::assets/Images/DevSpacesConsole.png[Dev Spaces Console]

. Select the terminal window on the top left and open up a new terminal
+
image::Terminal.png[Terminal Window]

. Change directory once again into the sample-app directory by running the following command
+
 $ cd sample-app

. Compile the simpleweb application by running the following command
+
 $ go build \
     -buildvcs=false \
     -a \
     -installsuffix cgo \
     -o ./simpleweb \
     .


== 2.1.1. Building Your First Container Image 

Once `simpleweb` is compiled successfully, we can now go ahead to build the container image! 

For building the container image, we will be making use of Podman Build command. `podman build` builds an image using instructions from one or more Containerfile(s) a specified build context directory. 

. Run the following on your Visual Studio Code 
+
 $ podman build -t podman-simpleweb:v1 .

. Validate that the container image has been built successfully 
+
 $ podman images
   REPOSITORY                           TAG                  IMAGE ID      CREATED        SIZE
   localhost/podman-simpleweb           v1                   c911c3159e2a  6 seconds ago  222 MB
   registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi  8.8-1067.1697633337  0dc8d21c3cb0  2 weeks ago    215 MB


== 2.1.2. Pushing the Container Image Into Your Quay Registry

Now that we have successsfully built our container image, we shall push this image into the Quay registry. 
You will need to first login to the Quay registry using the following command

. Login to Quay Registry 
+
 $ podman login \
     registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-vcdn4.sandbox1757.opentlc.com \
     --username %USER% \
     --password redhat


. Tag the Container Image
+
 $ podman tag \
     localhost/podman-simpleweb:v1 \
     registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-vcdn4.sandbox1757.opentlc.com/%USER%/podman-simpleweb:v1

. Push the Container Image into your Quay Registry
+
 $ podman push registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-vcdn4.sandbox1757.opentlc.com/%USER%/podman-simpleweb:v1

. Verify that the image has been built on Quay using the following link
+
 xx

== 2.1.3. Accessing Your MicroShift Instance

Now that your have your container image in your Quay Registry, you can now access into your MicroShift instance and deploy the simeplweb application using that container image. 

. Access your MircoShift VM via SSH
+
 $ ssh rhde@xxxxxx
+ 
When prompted with password, use - xxx


== 2.1.4. Pulling the Container Image from your Quay Registry

. Login to Quay Registry 
+
 $ podman login \
     registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-vcdn4.sandbox1757.opentlc.com \
     --username %USER% \
     --password redhat

. Pull the podman-simpleweb:v1 image from the Quay registry
+
 $ podman pull registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-vcdn4.sandbox1757.opentlc.com/%USER%/podman-simpleweb:v1

. Validate that the container image has been successfully pulled and you should be able to see the podman-simpleweb image. 
+
 $ podman images
   REPOSITORY                                                                                       TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE
   registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-jgt4p.sandbox1207.opentlc.com/user1/podman-simpleweb  v1          27970bae2dae  10 minutes ago  222 MB


== 2.1.5. Building the container using the podman-simpleweb image

. Build and run with podman run command, let's name this container: podman-simpleweb
+
 $ podman run -d -p 8080:8080 --name podman-simpleweb 
   registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-jgt4p.sandbox1207.opentlc.com/user1/podman-simpleweb:v1

. Verify that the container is running successfully
+
 $ podman ps
  CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                                                                               COMMAND     CREATED         STATUS        PORTS       NAMES
  29bc1542e8e2  registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.cluster-jgt4p.sandbox1207.opentlc.com/user1/podman-simpleweb:v1              14 seconds ago  Up 2 seconds              podman-simpleweb

. Setting up the firewall 
+
 $ Opening TCP port 8080
   firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp
+ 
 $ Reload the firewall
   firewall-cmd --reload
+
 $ Restart the firewall
   systemctl restart firewalld

== 2.1.6. Testing the application

. Use the curl command to test the application
 $ curl localhost:8080 

== 2.1.7. Congratulations!

You have successfully compiled and built your application using the container image and created a container from the image! Moving on to the next section, we will make a change in the source code and re-build the container to see the reflected changes.
